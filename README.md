# OPCare

OPCare is an Android mobile application to handle queuing of pre-check and walk-in medical clinic patients. OPCare revolutionizes the patient/provider experience by finally putting agency back into the hands of the patient. Instead of having to wait up to hours to be seen, use OPCare to reclaim your time. OPCare is healthcare in your hands.

### Features
OPCare collects patient information during account creation, which is later used to quickly facilitate pre-check and walk-in patients. Current wait time is estimated using database-level analytics of queued patients' chief complaint, severity of pain, and historical data. After check-in, queuing automatically orders walk-in patients, by emergency of case and check-in time. For pre-checked patients, the application only allows these patients to claim their spot in the queue when they are both 10 minutes before/after the time of appointment and within 1 mile of the clinic. 

### Project State
The front-end of the application has been completed using sample user data. Back-end database management is a work in progress.

## Background 
This application was developed as part of a hackathon in Eden Prairie, MN on July 11-12.
